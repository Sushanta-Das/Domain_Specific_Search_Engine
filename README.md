## Features:
**Domain-Specific Search Engine:** Focuses on providing accurate and efficient search results for Python-related queries.

**Web Crawling and Data Collection:** Utilized web crawling to gather a comprehensive collection of Python-related webpages, which were then converted into vector embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval in the Pinecone Vector Database.

**Similarity Search:** Employs vector embeddings to perform similarity searches, ensuring that search results are highly relevant to the query.
HTTP Server Implementation: Developed an HTTP server using socket programming to handle client requests, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions.
